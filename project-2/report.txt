(a)

The most difficult part of this assignment was calculating the tax on income in the least convoluted way possible. For example, I thought a little bit about the best way to change the second bracket's tax if the occupation is "nurse" or "teacher." Instead of creating an extra if statement, I decided to just change the value of the SECOND_BRACKET_TAX variable if the occupation input was one of those two professions.

Negative # of children (bob Joe, 32.12, chef, -3)
Negative tax due to children (bob, 50, plumber, 5)
Empty name ( , 84, firefighter, 0)

	Has special occupation and children(Joe blow, 125000, nurse, 5)
Edge case: income is 55000
	No children or special occupation (Joe blow, 55000, doctor, 0)
	Has children, but no special occupation (Joe blow, 55000, doctor, 10)
	Has special occupation, but no children (Joe blow, 55000, nurse, 0)
	Has special occupation and children (Joe blow, 55000, nurse, 10)
